# INVARIANTS: The Constants of AXIS (v1.4.0)

1. **Deterministic Execution:** No critical command can have an undefined execution time. WCET is the law.
2. **Physical Sovereignty:** A digital confirmation is void if it contradicts the Triangulated Physical State (PST).
3. **Hardware Identity:** A command is only valid if it is cryptographically bound to the physical DNA (PUF) of the actuator.
4. **Fail-Operational Integrity:** The loss of the primary oracle (PoPT) must trigger an immediate transition to a pre-validated Safe-State (Limp Home) after 30 seconds of instability.
5. **No Blind Trust:** Every high-risk action must be validated by two independent, heterogeneous processing streams.
