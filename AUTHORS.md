# AUTHORS: The Architect of AXIS

## 🏛 Main Author
**André Luiz Trindade**  
*Chief Architect & Ontological Engineer*

André Luiz Trindade is the visionary behind the AXIS Framework. After establishing TRINDADE governance (9.0) and PoPT time consensus (9.5), André solved the "Last Mile" problem: how to move the world without losing logic. 

Operating from a legacy workstation, he proved that high-fidelity execution requires hardened architectural logic, not high-cost hardware. AXIS completes his Trinity of Trust: Thinking (TRINDADE), Measuring (PoPT), and Acting (AXIS).
